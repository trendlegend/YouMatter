# YouMatter Project Tutorial

## How to Run the App
1.  **Start the App**: Click the green "Run" button at the top of the Replit editor.
2.  **Open the App**: Once the server starts, the "Webview" tab will open with your app. You can also open it in a new tab.

## How to Use the App
1.  **Chat**: Click "Chat Now" or navigate to the Chat page. Type your feelings or questions. The AI (powered by Google Gemini) will respond supportively.
2.  **Resources**: Click "Resources" in the navigation to see a list of mental health hotlines and apps.
3.  **Emergency**: If you are in crisis, use the emergency numbers listed (988).

## For the Hackathon Submission
1.  **MVP Link**: The link to your published Replit app (click "Publish" in top right if you want a public link, or just use the Replit URL).
2.  **GitHub Link**: Replit automatically creates a Git repo. You can push it to GitHub from the Git tab.
3.  **Video**: Record your screen while using the app (Chatting, viewing Resources). Explain the problem (student stress) and solution (AI companion).
4.  **Presentation**: A `presentation.md` file has been created in your files. You can copy its content into a Google Slides or PowerPoint deck and save as PDF.

## Troubleshooting
- If the chat doesn't respond, refresh the page.
- If the app shows an error, check the Console logs in Replit.
