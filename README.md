## 📌 Overview

**YouMatter** is an AI-driven mental health support web application designed specifically for students. It provides a safe, private, and judgment-free space where students can express their feelings, seek emotional support, and access relevant mental health resources anytime, anywhere.

Built using **Google Gemini AI**, YouMatter acts as an always-available first point of support, helping bridge the gap between students and professional mental health services.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Students today face intense academic pressure, social expectations, financial stress, and uncertainty about their future. These challenges have significantly increased cases of anxiety, depression, burnout, and emotional distress.

Despite the growing need, access to mental health support remains limited due to:

* Social stigma around mental health
* Shortage of counselors on campuses
* Long waiting times for appointments
* Lack of awareness about available resources

As a result, many students struggle silently, and early warning signs often go unnoticed.

---

## 💡 Solution

**YouMatter** addresses this gap by offering an AI-powered mental health chatbot that provides immediate, empathetic, and confidential support to students.

### What YouMatter Does:

* Allows students to openly share their thoughts and emotions
* Responds with empathetic, context-aware messages
* Encourages healthy coping strategies
* Guides users toward appropriate mental health resources when needed

> ⚠️ *YouMatter is not a replacement for professional therapy but serves as an early support and guidance system.*
